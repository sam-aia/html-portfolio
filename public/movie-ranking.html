<h1>The best book series according to Samaia</h1>
<h2>My top three book series of all time</h2>

<hr/>

<h3>Harry Potter</h3>
<p>So immersive, making you want to jump into the pages. Also great to see the characters grow</p>

<h3>Mistborn</h3>
<p>Amazing endings and fantastic plot-twists</p>

<h3>Twilight</h3>
<p>So sorry, it's my guilty pleasure I can't help it, it's so bad it's good!</p>
